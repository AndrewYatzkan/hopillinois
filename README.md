# hopIllinois
hopIllinois is a 2-d platform game for University of Illinois students. The game emulates the Urbana-Champaign campus, designed in beautiful pixel art and a retro feel. Created for HackIllinois 2023.

## Features
1. Illinois log in allows for secure access and reduced privacy concerns.
2. Users are geolocated on campus and placed in the game map based on their real location. From here, they can move in real life to navigate the game.
3. Users can see events happening around campus on the game, and are able to create events themselves.
4. (Extension) Users have three stats: {Happy, Healthy, Smart} that change based on how they interact with the game. In particular, frequent logins will keep their sprite happy, attending events and recreational activities will keep them healthy, and being in study spaces and/or classrooms will make them smart.
